# Introduction

This specification describes a communication protocol for control, configuration and monitoring of connected devices. The application layer protocol is widely independent of the underlying transport protocols and physical interfaces, so it can be used with e.g. CAN, USB, WiFi, Bluetooth or a simple serial interface.

Even though this protocol was developed with the focus on energy management, it can be used for other purposes aswell. The specification is published under a permissive license for both commercial and personal use.

The working name of the protocol is ThingSet Protocol - a protocol for settings of "things".

It is planned that these are the last breaking changes to the core protocol before finalizing the protocol version v1.0.</p><ul><li>Paths can be absolute (starting with <code>/</code> and including the node ID) to support accessing a node behind a ThingSet gateway.</li><li>The node ID can now also be added to the response (text and binary mode) and the redundant status message of the text mode is replaced with an optional diagnostic payload.</li><li>Discovery in the text mode now uses a fetch request with JSON <code>null</code> as the argument instead of a trailing <code>/</code>. This is more consistent with the binary mode and allows better mapping between the two. In addition to that it avoids confusion for <code>?/</code> requests, where it was not obvious if it&#39;s a discovery request for the root path of a node or an absolute path.</li><li>Discovery in the binary mode now uses CBOR <code>null</code> (<code>0xF6</code>) instead of <code>undefined</code> (<code>0xF7</code>) in order to be directly compatible with the text mode. JSON has no equivalent of an <code>undefined</code> value.</li><li>The function code for the CREATE function in binary mode is now <code>0x06</code> (mapped to CoAP PATCH) to make it clearly distinguishable from a POST request and allow unambiguous mapping to the text mode.</li><li>New response codes <code>0xC4</code> and <code>0xC5</code> for gateways were added.</li><li>Physical quantities (e.g. <code>Voltage</code>) must now be part of data item names and are not derived from the unit. This was necessary because a unit cannot be unambiguously mapped to a physical quantity (e.g. <code>Pa</code> can be used for a pressure as well as mechanical stress).</li><li>Internal groups like <code>_Paths</code> (prefixed with <code>_</code>) are now called overlays and start with uppercase letters like all other groups.</li><li>Response code <code>0x84</code> (Changed) is used for responses to EXEC requests, as the previously used <code>0x83</code> (Valid) is not allowed to have any payload in CoAP.</li></ul>',10),i={render:function(e,t){return a}}}}]);

They are detected automatically and no content-type header is needed.</li><li>Predefined URI layout matching the data structure.</li><li>Unit of data objects stored in the name (key) of a map, so the required amount of nesting in the JSON data structure is limited to categories only.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The response codes of ThingSet are aligned with CoAP and thus also allow a simple translation to HTTP. The main difference is that HTTP doesn&#39;t allow to indicate successful requests as fine-grained as CoAP, so the status will be mostly 200 OK or 204 No Content.</p>',8),i={render:function(e,t){return n}}}}]);
